Hello from all of us!

This is the start of an adventure! Tonight, we met to finalize our sprint one objectives and plot a course for the next week. Our project is to create a portable braille printer! This sprint, our main objective is to get a machine that punches dimples in paper effectively. We are super excited to get started and will keep you in the loop as we continue!

Love,
The PoE Team
