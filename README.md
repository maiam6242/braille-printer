## Introduction
The Portabraille Printer is a device that takes in an English text input, translates that text into (SPECIFY CONTRACTED V UNCONTRACTED) braille, then prints said braille text on braille paper. It is a low cost product that aims to allow people who are visually impaired to create braille quickly, with applications ranging from producing quick meeting notes to creating accessible promotional materials on the fly. (CHECK THIS) The printer is light, with a handle for easy transportation, and has an easy-to-use interface with both braille and English text, creating a user friendly experience for those who are visually impaired or blind.

## This Repository
This repository contains the vast majority of the files which we created over the course of this project. The [Text Side Folder](https://github.com/maiam6242/braille-printer/tree/master/Text%20Side "Text Side Folder") has software that takes a text input, converts it to a braille output and sends it to the firmware. All of this is written in Python. The firmware that controls the way paper is loaded and how solenoids act is in the [Arduino Firmware Folder](https://github.com/maiam6242/braille-printer/tree/master/ArduinoFirmware "Arduino Firmware Folder"). All of our firmware is written in C++. The [Interface Folder](https://github.com/maiam6242/braille-printer/tree/master/Interface "Interface Folder") contains software written in Python and designs created in Illustrator which relate to the user interface on our printer. The [PCB Folder](https://github.com/maiam6242/braille-printer/tree/master/PCB "PCB Folder") contains all of the artifacts from our PCB design and the [README Resources Folder](https://github.com/maiam6242/braille-printer/tree/master/README%20Resources "README Resources Folder") contains all of the files referenced in this document.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the Fall 2019 Teaching Team, Professors Aaron Hoover, Amon Millner, Siddhartan Govindasamy and Stan Reifel for their support and assistance throughout this process. Additional thanks to Frank Ventura, Jerry Berrier, David Kingsbury, John Smith, and Jeanette **LASTNAME** and for their INDISPENSABLE help during this adventure. The insights they provided about our design helped us craft a product that is actually usable. Lastly, thank you to the MIT Visually Impaired and Blind User Group for hosting us and letting us pick their brains regarding our printer and braille in general.
